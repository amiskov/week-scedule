# Weekly Schedule Template
Weekly schedule template inspired by “[12 Week Year](http://12weekyear.com/)” book ([Russian version](http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/12_nedel_v_godu/)). I found this template more useful than usual diary for getting shit done.

Print it on two sides on one A4 sheet.

## How to use
* Now you have 12 weeks in year instead of 12 months.
* Plan your next “12 week year” and use this schedule for getting things done every week.
* You will hardly have time to do everything, that's OK, just keep going.
* After finishing your “12 week year” take a break and rest for awhile (1 or 2 weeks).
* Check this repository for updates and repeat :)

## TODO
* Generate printable schedule for all weeks in year.
* Add title with number of the week in “12 week year”.
* Find a way to combine all weeks in handy format.
* Year must have a nice cover with dates and maybe goals.
