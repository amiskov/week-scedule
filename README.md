# Weekly Schedule Template
Weekly schedule template inspired by “[12 Week Year](http://12weekyear.com/)” book ([Russian version](http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/12_nedel_v_godu/)). I found this template more useful than usual diary for getting shit done.

## How to use
PDF-file contains 2 pages. Print them on A4 sheet on both sides.

* Now you have 12 weeks in year instead of 12 months.
* Plan your next “12 week year” and use this schedule for getting things done every week.
* You will hardly have time to do everything, that's OK, just keep going.
* After finishing your “12 week year” take a break and rest for awhile (1 or 2 weeks).
* Repeat.

## TODO
- [ ] Add English version.
- [ ] Generate printable schedule for all weeks in year.
- [ ] Add title with number of the week in “12 week year”.
- [ ] Find a way to combine all weeks in handy format.
- [ ] Year must have a nice cover with dates and maybe goals.
